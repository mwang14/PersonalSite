Hello! If you have decided to take time out of your day to read the first post in what is bound to be a horrendous excuse for a blog then thank you! I have thought about writing a blog for a while, but there was always a doubting voice in the back of my head. That voice said, "No one cares what you have to say." Well today, I respond with fuck that! If no one cares what I have to say, that's alright with me. But if someone does care what I have to say, even better.

So, I've decided to start a blog. Now I have to decide, what it is I'll be blogging about.

## Topics
-----

### Deep Learning/Data Science

As of right now, I believe I want to become a Data Scientist. This will likely involve reading academic papers, implementing algorithms myself, and exploring data analysis and visualization. I think these types of things lend themselves very easily to writing blog posts. I plan on writing reviews of my personal work, sharing my thoughts on practices within the field, and writing tutorials. I'm hoping that doing this will improve my understanding of these topics, and my ability to articulate ideas.

### Programming

Though I am working on moving into Data Science, I am currently a Computer Science major at Northeastern University. I still love programming, and likely will talk about different programming concepts, and potentially any hacks I come up with in scripts that I write. I may even do programming heavy projects in the future, likely focusing on functional programming.

### Tech News

I do my best to keep up with big news in the tech industry. If anything big comes up that I find interesting or worth talking about, I'll write a post about it.

### Random

Any random stuff that comes to my mind! Right now I'm playing a lot of chess, and practicing piano so maybe those will come up. I'm a big baseball fan (Let's go Mets!), and I love a nice cup of loose leaf tea. Basically, any random thing that interests me may leak here.

## Conclusion

So that's it for my "Hello World" post. Hopefully this is my first step into a new hobby.
