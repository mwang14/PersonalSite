**TL;DR**: Andrew Ng's deep learning specialization is a good way to get started in deep learning, but can be passed without learning the material. It definitely does not leave you completely prepared to work on produciton level machine learning projects, though I do not believe that is what it's intended for..

I recently completed Andrew Ng's deep learning specialization on Coursera ([deeplearning.ai](http://deeplearning.ai)), and ended up with mixed feelings about my experience. In this post, I will talk about what I enjoyed about the specialization, and what I didn't, so that anyone else who is thinking about completing it can make an informed decision, especially before paying.

## The Good

The first thing that helped me get started with the specialization was that a one week free trial was offered. This allowed me to explore the coursework without having to pay. However, in order to register you did need to give a credit card which at the end of your one week trial is automatically charged. This can be a bit frustrating, but I'm sure that if you forget to cancel you can ask for a refund. Even so, at only $49 per month, the specialization is not very expensive. I managed to finish it in two months, but could have finished it in a shorter period of time if I dedicated more of my time to it.

Once you start the courses, the first thing you notice is that the quality of Andrew Ng's lectures is extremely high. Just like in his Machine Learning course, also available on Coursera, Andrew (Andrew Ng? Professor Ng?) has a way of making difficult concepts easy to understand. You do not need to have a deep understanding of Calculus or Linear Algebra in order to understand the course material, though it definitely helps. If you are interested in the underlying math, there are a few optional videos that delve deeper into the math. Andrew also consistently sites important papers for the topics covered. I found that when reading these papers I got a bit more of an in depth understanding of the concepts being presented, and I will be revisiting some of these in the future when I need to either brush up on material, or go deeper, no pun intended. Ok, pun completely intended.

Another nice touch was Heroes of Deep Learning series, which was a series of interviews with big names in the Deep Learning community. I think this is a great way to expose people new to Deep Learning to some important figures, so that they can explore their work, and potentially find areas of interest. I have yet to watch these interviews, but I plan to check them out when I have free time ðŸ˜….

A final note, is that the course forums were very helpful. Whenever I had issues with a homework or a concept, I could always go to the forums and find someone else who had the same problem as I had. If I couldn't find my question, I usually got a response within a day of posting a question, which was very helpful.

## The not so Good

The main issue I found throughout the specialization was the homeworks. In Andrew's previous Machine Learning course, the homeworks were done in Matlab, and for this specialization they moved to python notebooks, which is a notable improvement in my opinion. However, that's where the improvements ended. I found that the problems given in the homework were appropriate for the material learned, but that I didn't have to try very hard to get the problems done. The main reason for this was that a lot of coding scaffolding was often given, including line by line comments on what to do. It felt like I was being spoonfed the answers to the problems, without having to even understand the concepts to complete the homeworks. Because I wanted to learn the material I took the homeworks seriously, but you definitely didn't have to. I think that having the homeworks be so spoonfed decreases the value of obtaining the specialization.

Another key issue with the homeworks was that they often felt rushed. There were often errors in the documentation, and sometimes even in the grader. Thankfully, the forums were very helpful when encountering issues, but it was still very frustrating to go through what felt like an incomplete product. This is probably due to Andrew Ng's split attention, with news recently coming out that he is starting a [175 million dollar AI fund](https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/30/andrew-ng-officially-launches-his-175m-ai-fund/).

A final small gripe that I had was that the final course on sequence models was not released initially. I did not face this problem, but I'm sure that many people had to wait for it to be released before finishing the specialization. This shouldn't be an issue in the future, but just something to note.

## Overall

I think that overall this specialization is a fine place to start exploring deep learning. I expect that some of the issues I had will be worked out over time, which will make the specialization even better.
