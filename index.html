  <h1 class="box_header">About Me</h1>
    <p class="body_text">I started coding in High School when my older brother suggested I try the introduction to coding class. Since then, I've taken on coding as one of my passions. Lately, I've been teaching myself how to use Django as a way to improve my knowledge of back end web development and python.</p>
      
    <p class="body_text">In my free time, I like coding, running, writing short stories and articles, and playing Super Smash Bros Melee with my friends. I even go to smash tournaments, and can be found rocking the tag Scratchin Magician. I love listening to rap and indie rock, and am always taking recommendations on new artists. Though I hail from New York City, I'm in Boston for most of the year, as I study at Northeastern University.

      <p class = "body_text">Last year, I decided to make a multiple choice test maker in Java. The user would input questions through a Swing UI, and then when finished, the program would make word documents for multiple versions of the test the user gave, and answer keys for each version. I plan to use my new knowledge of Django to remake this program as a web app with updated functionality including the ability to save tests for future work.</p>

It was one of the first times that I saw a real application of the math I was learning in class. I decided to make a trigonometric function calculator from scratch, using the taylor series to calculate the values. I had a great time making it, and though it's not pretty, I'm pretty happy with how the project turned out. The code for this project, along with all my other projects, can be found on my GitHub.</p>

    <h1 class="box_header">Experience</h1>
    <h3 class = "experienceHeader">Software Development Co-op: Basis Technology</h3>
    <p class= "body_text">During my first co-op I worked as a software developer for Basis Technology. I did the entirety of my work on their open source digital forensics tool Autopsy. I very much enjoyed my time there, as I learned how to work around a public API, create thread safe classes, store data in a database, and use git in a company environment. Further, I was treated as a fully capable member of the team, as my code was implemented within Autopsy within the first week, and my input on design decisions was highly valued by my superiors.</p>
    <h3 class = "experienceHeader">Fundamentals of Computer Science 2 Tutor: Northeastern University</h3>
    <p class="body_text">Last year, I was hired by Northeastern University to be a tutor for the class Fundamentals of Computer Science 2. I have gained a lot of experience on the job in communication, and teaching. I often times find it difficult helping students without giving them the answer, but have received positive feedback from students on my teaching style.</p>
    <h3 class = "experienceHeader">Customer Service Representative: Offerpop</h3>
    <p class="body_text">The summer following my junior year of high school I worked as a customer service representative at Offerpop, a social media marketing company. My main daily responsibilities included answering general questions of customers, and assisting in designing custom HTML and CSS for their campaigns. I very much enjoyed my time at Offerpop, and gained significant experience in professionalism, customer interaction, and using HTML and CSS.</p>
